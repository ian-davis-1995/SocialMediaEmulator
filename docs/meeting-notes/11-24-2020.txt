TODO: Implement a way to ask "attention check" questions like "what day of the week is it?" randomize the order of that question in the feed perhaps.
    If they fail the attention checks they should go to the end of the experiment.

DONE:
Implement a way to feed in the post data.
Post a sample json format of the post data on basecamp, along with a visual diagram indicating how the keys are used to render the post.
