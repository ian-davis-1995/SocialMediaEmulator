- Did some testing and fixed bugs with the filler post type in the emulator.
- Did some testing and fixed bugs with the static hosting of images in the emulator web server.

- Did some research on ways to either seamlessly navigate between a qualtrics survey and the emulator and back, or to embed the emulator directly in a qualtrics survey.

TODO: Determine if I can make the list questions specific subquestions in the "Request Response" condition in matrix type questions.
TODO: Can we integrate the emulator with a Qualtrics survey, where they start the survey, go to the emulator and then come back to the survey and continue?
TODO: Bring the OSPAN tasks into the feed.
TODO: Verify the dashboard has everything it needs and works as expected. Identify todos if not.
