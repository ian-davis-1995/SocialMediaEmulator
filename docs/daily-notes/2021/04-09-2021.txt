- Put the two infographics into the emulator and uploaded new screenshots of them.

TODO: Create two posts in the emulator with the following texts:
    - "By getting enough hours of sleep, you will improve memory and concentration."
    - "By not getting enough hours of sleep, you will impair memory and concentration."
    - Maybe in a meme format or post from a user.
    - Infographic on positive/negative benefits of sleep/not enough sleep.
