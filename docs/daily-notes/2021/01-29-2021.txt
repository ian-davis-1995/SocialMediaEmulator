- Finished reading through the rest of the probes and provided feedback.

- Got the Reading span task E-Prime stuff loaded and began implementing the React based version.

- Got an initial version of the practice letter sequence of the reading span task integrated in React. Having trouble running the E-Prime experiment, it doesn't register my mouse clicks on the grid so I can't go forward.

- Implemented the letter grid functionality fully and added in handling of the letter order and verifying it against the expected order for the practice. Still have been unsuccessful in running the original experiment in e-studio.
