- Got an initial implementation of the Sentence Practice sequence, but need to verify that my interpretations of the E-Prime code are correct.

- Refactored the practice sentence and letter blocs to be more decoupled, which will make it easier to reuse stuff for the actual experiment bloc.
- Figured out the problems with running the ospan and rspan tasks in E-Prime, I needed to configure which monitor it ran on on my computer. Took screenshots of both, but wasn't able to run the sspan task because we are missing bitmaps.

- Got everything refactored fully and properly now, much happier with the structure. Everything is type checked and states and events make good sense.
- Added in a way for debugging the app at different points by setting an initial app state.
- Revamping the look and feel of the experiment to match the original better and be more consistent with font sizes and the like.

- Adding in feedback state for the letter practice to show how many were correctly recalled.
- Adding in feedback state for the sentence practice to show whether or not the choice was correct.
