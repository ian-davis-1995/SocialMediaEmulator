- Removing all "Do You Have Questions?" prompts from the instructions.
- Fixed the feedback page to layout the percentage and results properly.
- Adding a next button to the true/false page that goes to the next page, to prevent users from auto clicking through the experiment.

- Broke up the actual trials from the practice trials with a screen indicating the actual trial is beginning.

- Adjusting font sizing to work better on all display sizes.
- Making the instructions require a click inside the last continue prompt instead of anywhere on the screen to allow for scrolling the page if necessary.
- Fixing some overflow issues with the instructions on small mobile displays.
- Implemented a minimum reading time of 750ms, where if the user clicks past the sentence sooner than that, the click is ignored.
- Moved the feedback box for sentence up above the button row so it doesn't stretch things out when the screen width is smaller.

Reading Span checklist
[DONE] One of the first screens say "in this experiment" maybe change to "in this portion of the experiment"
[DONE] Remove the two prompts of "do you have any questions so far?"
[DONE] Sentences not properly randomized, duplicates were allowed.
[DONE] Change language for EXIT button to SUBMIT
[DONE] Remove language about check boxes
[DONE] Missing space between "onthe" on second to last screen
[DONE] Red percentage in top right corner during trials
[DONE] Implement a next button on the true/false page that users must press, which prevents fast clicking through sentences.
[DONE] Break up the actual trials from the practice trials.
[DONE] Font size seemed too big on a 13-inch screen size.
[DONE] Minimum reading time on sentences of 750ms. Tested this myself and I found that the only times I hit this was on accidental clicks.

[FEEDBACK] Add virtual chinrest to test viewing angle. Do we want this to be part of the experiment? Something only the team uses to test angles initially?
[FEEDBACK] Filter through the sentence pool and take out controversial statements.
[FEEDBACK] Should we prompt a five second break before beginning the actual task?
[FEEDBACK] Should we tell subjects not to write anything down?
[FEEDBACK] Should we tell subjects to say letters out loud?
[FEEDBACK] Should we say not to rehearse or assume the sentence reading portion will prevent that?
[FEEDBACK] Are we going to enforce the 85% requirement noted in the original instructions?
[FEEDBACK] More direct statement about speed/accuracy tradeoff.
[FEEDBACK] Are letters randomized properly?
