        "storySummary": "Recently, two men and a woman walked out of the San Antonio Aquarium in Texas, pushing a 16-inch long horn shark in a stroller. The trio had swiped the shark, whose name is Miss Helen, from a tide pool exhibit where visitors are able to touch marine creatures held in open tanks. Fortunately, after a whirlwind weekend and a speedy police pursuit, Miss Helen is now safely back at the aquarium. ",

            "\"Recently, two men and a woman walked out of the San Antonio Aquarium in Texas, pushing a 16-inch long horn shark in a stroller. The trio had swiped the shark, whose name is Miss Helen, from a tide pool exhibit where visitors are able to touch marine creatures held in open tanks. Fortunately, after a whirlwind weekend and a speedy police pursuit, Miss Helen is now safely back at the aquarium.",
            "On the day of the theft, the three suspects walked through the aquarium in plain view of other visitors—and the building’s security cameras. Surveillance footage shows one of the men scooping Miss Helen out of the tank and rushing out of frame, followed by the other man. The woman paces near a stroller. The men return, holding something that appears to be covered with a wet towel, which they place in the stroller’s undercarriage. We now know that the two male suspects entered a side room and put Miss Helen into a bucket of water before the trio hurried off.",
            "One staff member, alerted to suspicious behavior near the touch tank, followed the thieves into the parking lot, but was not permitted to search their vehicle. Police were called, and as Daniel Victor of the Times reports, they tracked the getaway vehicle to a home belonging to one of the suspects. Inside was a pool filled with marine animals—including Miss Helen.",
            "The chief of the Leon Valley Police Department stated that the pool looked “like almost a mockup [of the aquarium].” The resident of the home “very much knew what he was doing. [He] kept that animal alive and was able to continue to see that animal thrive, which was pretty shocking to all of us.”",
            "One of the individuals found at the home has since been charged with theft of property, while charges for the other two suspects are pending.",
            "Miss Helen appears to be faring well in the wake of her ordeal. “She’s very healthy,” said the aquarium's assistant husbandry director. “I’m glad the thieves did take care of her… She’s going to have a nice, healthy life it seems.”"

        "storySummary": "The Skellig Islands are more stunning and other-worldly than any of the special effects of the past two Star Wars movies. Long before Luke Skywalker arrived on the scene, the real-life towering rock outcroppings glimpsed in the closing moments of the 2015 film The Force Awakens and now playing a starring role in the blockbuster, The Last Jedi, have been a sacred place of retreat, pilgrimage and sanctuary.",

            "The Skellig Islands are more stunning and other-worldly than any of the special effects of the past two Star Wars movies. Long before Luke Skywalker arrived on the scene, the real-life towering rock outcroppings glimpsed in the closing moments of the 2015 film The Force Awakens and now playing a starring role in the blockbuster, The Last Jedi, have been a sacred place of retreat, pilgrimage and sanctuary.",
            "Although the Great Skellig, also known as Skellig Michael and Sceilig Mhichíl, and the Lesser (or Little) Skellig appear to be in a galaxy far, far away, they are in fact about eight miles off the dramatic southwest Atlantic coast of Ireland. The puffins of Skellig Michael are said to be the inspiration for those too-cute-by-far porgs, the indigenous inhabitants of Luke Skywalker’s island, named Ahch-To in the films. But the porgs have nothing on the almost comical puffin.",
            "Trekking up 618 steps cut into the sea-bitten cliffs, a visitor arrives at Great Skellig’s ancient monastery near its 715-foot summit. Several structures have miraculously survived Viking raids, relentless gales and the test of time. Inspired by the Coptic Church of Egypt and Libya, and St. Anthony in the Desert, Gaelic Christian monks sought extreme solitude here beginning sometime in the 6th to 8th centuries and lasting through the late 12th or early 13th century.",
            "There one can find the remains of an abbey, with a later medieval church built upon it, two oratory chapels, a cemetery with stone crosses, and, on the southern of the two peaks, the remnants of a hermitage with three separate terraces. Six complete drystone beehive cells, or dwelling houses, were home to an estimated 12 monks and an abbot. The church, unlike the beehive dwellings, was erected with mortar and dedicated at least in the 11th century to Saint Michael.",
            "Following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1578, the islands passed to the private ownership of the Butler family. The Irish Government took possession in the 1820s to erect two lighthouses. One became automated in the 1980s, maintaining a still much-needed beacon on the Atlantic side, where the seas are unpredictable and often turbulent. Since 1880, the Irish Office of Public Works took over maintenance of the archaeological site.",
            "Little Skellig, where boats are not allowed to land, is a seabird sanctuary to one of the largest colonies in the world of northern gannets. The islands are also protected habitats for Manx shearwaters, northern fulmar, black-legged kittiwake, razorbill, guillemot, peregrine falcon and storm petrel. But the area is best known for the colorful-beaked puffins.",
            "The record of the Skellig Islands is long and can be traced in libraries and archives. The death of a monk is noted in the Martyrology of Tallaght, a manuscript dating from the end of the 8th century. The rock formations appear in charts from the 14th century and are referenced in contemporary accounts of the 1588 Spanish Armada. The first modern description of Skellig Michael is in Charles Smith’s Antient and Present State of the County of Kerry of 1756.",
            "Some accounts in the 18th and 19th centuries erroneously note that the Skelligs were made up of three separate islands, as the craggy peaks appear when viewed at a distance from the mainland, and to be made of marble. The legend is that the monastery was founded by St. Finnian of Clonard, one of the fathers of Irish monasticism, although there is no evidence of this. Nicholas Carlisle’s A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (London, 1810) repeats these claims. What the various books all emphasize is the Skelligs’ remoteness and spiritual nature.",
            "While inhabited for an incredibly lengthy period, the monastery was abandoned probably by the early 13th century, while remaining as a place of periodic penitence and continued pilgrimage. This relocation was also due to the monastic life in Ireland moving away from the ascetic Celtic model with its emphasis on solitude to the more engaged Augustinian Church.",
            "The enigmatic island of hermetic monks, devoted to a life of prayer and study, has long been venerated, serving as a place of sacred pilgrimage since the medieval period, and a site to study bird life without much human interference. But can Skellig Michael survive a new type of pilgrim, the legions of Star Wars fans?",
            "And about those sacred Jedi texts—wonderfully bound books and scrolls shelved in that tree library on the island. Like Luke, they are “the last of the Jedi religion.” Spoiler alert: the collection was apparently moved by Rey to the Millennium Falcon. Maybe a librarian will enter the scene in the next movie installment, ensuring the volumes are properly cataloged, conserved and disseminated for the preservation of the Force."
