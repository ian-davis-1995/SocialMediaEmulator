        title: "Stolen Shark",
        storySegments: [
            "Recently, two men and a woman walked out of the San Antonio Aquarium in Texas, pushing a 16-inch long horn shark in a stroller. The trio had swiped the shark, whose name is Miss Helen, from a tide pool exhibit where visitors are able to touch marine creatures held in open tanks. Fortunately, after a whirlwind weekend and a speedy police pursuit, Miss Helen is now safely back at the aquarium. (1/6)",
            "On the day of the theft, the three suspects walked through the aquarium in plain view of other visitors—and the building’s security cameras. Surveillance footage shows one of the men scooping Miss Helen out of the tank and rushing out of frame, followed by the other man. The woman paces near a stroller. The men return, holding something that appears to be covered with a wet towel, which they place in the stroller’s undercarriage. We now know that the two male suspects entered a side room and put Miss Helen into a bucket of water before the trio hurried off. (2/6)",
            "One staff member, alerted to suspicious behavior near the touch tank, followed the thieves into the parking lot, but was not permitted to search their vehicle. Police were called, and as Daniel Victor of the Times reports, they tracked the getaway vehicle to a home belonging to one of the suspects. Inside was a pool filled with marine animals—including Miss Helen. (3/6)",
            "The chief of the Leon Valley Police Department stated that the pool looked “like almost a mockup [of the aquarium].” The resident of the home “very much knew what he was doing. [He] kept that animal alive and was able to continue to see that animal thrive, which was pretty shocking to all of us.” (4/6)",
            "One of the individuals found at the home has since been charged with theft of property, while charges for the other two suspects are pending. (5/6)",
            "Miss Helen appears to be faring well in the wake of her ordeal. “She’s very healthy,” said the aquarium's assistant husbandry director. “I’m glad the thieves did take care of her… She’s going to have a nice, healthy life it seems.” (6/6)",
